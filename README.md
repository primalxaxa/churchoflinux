## Church of Linux

This is a website I made to convert Windows users to Linux.

It is mostly a meme but all the information on the website is legit and hopefully a few people will find it helpful if they are genuinely trying to jump ship from  Windows.

you can see the website [here](www.churchoflinux.org)
